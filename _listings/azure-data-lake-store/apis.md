name: Azure Data Lake Store
x-slug: azure-data-lake-store
description: The Data Lake store provides a single repository where you can capture
  data of any size type and speed simply without forcing changes to your application
  as the data scales. In the store, data can be shared for collaboration with enterprise-grade
  security. It is also designed for high-performance processing and analytics from
  HDFS applications (ie. Azure HDInsight, Data Lake analytics service, Hortonworks,
  Cloudera, MapR) and tools, including support for low latency workloads. For example,
  data can be ingested in real-time from sensors and devices for IoT solutions, or
  from online shopping websites into the store without the restriction of fixed limits
  on account or file size unlike current offerings in the market.
