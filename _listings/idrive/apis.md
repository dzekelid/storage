description: Built with developers in mind, IDrive Encrypted Versioned file System
  is a powerful, easy to use service that provides secure, encrypted and versioned
  cloud storage. Unlike other generic storage systems, IDrive EVS has storage encryption,
  versioning and block level incremental transfers built in both-ways for uploads
  and downloads. This gives you the freedom to develop innovative applications to
  customize your Backup, Storage, Sync, Sharing, Disaster recovery and more that are
  highly efficient, scalable and require minimal coding. It provides powerful APIs
  for uploading, retrieving, managing data and storage, at any time, from anywhere
  on the Internet.
