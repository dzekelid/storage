description: 'Theyve been developing embedded technologies for over 20 years - and
  have first-hand experience dealing with the lack of connectivity between devices,
  networks and users. The exponential growth in electronic data implores a ubiquitous
  connection tool. Exosites One Platform is that tool. Our goal is to make accessing
  and analyzing data easier than subscribing to a mobile phone service. '
