name: Put.io
description: Put.io, launched in 2009, is a cloud storage service with a BitTorrent
  engine that downloads and puts torrents into the usersrsquo; private online space.
  After purchasing a paid membership account, users are able to keep redundant copies
  of their files which can be accessed from anywhere with a browser. They can be accessed
  automatically from BitTorrent networks, FTPs, direct download links, RapidShare
  links, or basic HTTP authenticated links. The downloaded files are then streamed
  via a suitable player on a PC or smart TV. Torrent movies can be streamed this way,
  too. Users can store videos of their families, activities and work, and access them
  from where ever they want and whenever they choosenbsp;
